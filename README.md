🛰️ SmartRF: Reimagining Wireless Signal Intelligence with Deep Learning 🎯



📡 In today’s hyper-connected world, wireless communication signals like 5G, LTE, WiFi, ZigBee, and Bluetooth flood our surroundings. But can a system automatically recognize and classify these signals just from their spectral patterns?



🔍 Presenting SmartRF — a lightweight yet powerful AI-based RF signal classification system trained to identify 7 major wireless protocols from spectrogram images.



🚀 What We Did Differently:

✅ Generated synthetic + real-world spectrograms using MATLAB's waveform synthesis toolkit

✅ Built a custom deep learning pipeline based on ResNet-18, optimized for both accuracy and edge deployment

✅ Achieved a validation accuracy of 91.43%

✅ Created a MATLAB-to-Raspberry Pi deployment pipeline using ONNX conversion + Python ONNXRuntime

✅ Designed custom data augmentation and ensured class balance during training



📊 Why This Matters:

🔐 Security & Spectrum Monitoring: Automatic RF signal classification is crucial in military, smart cities, and telecom for spectrum surveillance and threat detection.

📱 IoT/Edge Deployment: The model is compact and efficient, ideal for low-power embedded boards like Raspberry Pi.

📡 Modular & Scalable: Easily expandable to other protocols like LoRa, NB-IoT, or even jamming signals.

🧠 Educational Value: Great example of bridging signal processing and AI, inspiring further research at the edge of telecom and ML.



🔧 Tools & Stack Used:

MATLAB for signal generation, augmentation, training & visualization

ONNXRuntime + Python for Raspberry Pi inference

ResNet18 + Custom Spectrogram Encoder

Confusion matrix, prediction splash plots & accuracy visualizations to support performance



🎯 This is just the beginning — future versions will support:

Real-time SDR data classification (RTL-SDR or HackRF)

Adversarial attack detection

Edge deployment on Coral TPU & NVIDIA Jetson Nano
